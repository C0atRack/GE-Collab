# Sprint Retrospective
## Things that Went Well

- Documention went well. It was very organized looked very clean, especially when formatting code segments.
- Issues were always discussed, and once a solution was found it was documented.

## Things to Improve

- Add more details to the project board.
- More separation of the roles.
	- Since this was the first Sprint we all kind of played each role to an extent.
